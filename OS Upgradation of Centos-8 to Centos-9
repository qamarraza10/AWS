**Testing**
First we have to do the testing if there will be any issuses when we will gprade the OS version, so if there are any issues we can test and resolve in our test enviromnet before launching the upgrade in Production environemt. 
Create a recent snapshot of the instance with all the volumes(EC2 Dashboard>EBS>Snapshots>Create Snapsot>Choose Instance>Instance ID>Create Button).

After the snapshot is created successfully: 
Select the snapshot>actions>copy snapshot>in description give a little details or instance name>destination region (choose region where we want to copy instance e.g london=eu-west-2)>click copy snapshot button.
Open the region from the top ribbon where you copy the instance and go to >EC2> Snapshots> select the root volume of the snapshot> click actions> create image from snapshot> go to images>AMIs and here you will see AMI image of snapshot.

Select the root AMI and launch it as an instance:
EC2 Dashboard> Images>AMIs> select AMI image>Launch Instance from AMI.

Launch Instance from AMI of new region:
Name: Give the name for server> Instance type (choose according to the requirement e.t t3.medium)
Key pair: if already have a keypair, if not then create a new key pair(Name: name you want, type: RSA, File format: .pem).
Network settings: edit>vpc required(default)>subnet (choose different e.g eu-west-2b)
Security group: choose ssh only if already created, if not created already then create security group:
e.g if we need security group only with ssh rule then: 
Security group name: ssh only, description: date of creation or any info you want add, inbound security group rules: type (ssh, protocol tcp, port rane:22)

Configure Storage: 
choose the size of the root storge volume accoding to the voilume size of your root volume size of the instance in production.
click on advancead>add new volume:
device name required: /dev/sdb;  >snapshot: select the related snapshot disk volume of as like the instance have volume in the production environemt. note: if we have multiple volumes need to attach all of these. 
size: give the size accordinly to the size of volume in production: e.g 100GB, > delete on termination: yes, becuase its a test instance so when we terminate the instance it will automatically delete the related volumes, and will save from resource utilization.
encrypted: leave as it is if their is no requiremnt for the encryption.

Access the instance by SSH and Telnet client and terminal emulator e.g secure CRT(for ssh access) and secure FX for loading script file in server.
